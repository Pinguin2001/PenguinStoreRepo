You must visit wiki to learn right way to do it.\n[EN] - https://storik4pro.github.io/en-US/LBrowser/ \n[RU] - https://storik4pro.github.io/ru-RU/LBrowser/ \n==========\nLines Browser is a \"Browser-as-a-Service\" solution that allows you to use the modern Internet on Windows 10 Mobile devices. Unlike other browsers on this platform, Lines Browser does not use the EdgeHTML engine.\n\nIt requires a PC running Windows 10 or 11 on the same network as the phone. All web-page processing happens on the PC, while the phone is used only for displaying the image, playing audio, and sending user commands. Thus, the smartphone acts as a remote terminal, and the main workload falls on the PC.",
